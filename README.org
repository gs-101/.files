** Encrypting a USB Drive with LUKS on Linux

[fn:1]

*** Encryption Process

1. Identify the disk with =fdisk=

#+begin_src sh
  sudo fdisk -l
#+end_src

2. Encrypt the device

#+begin_src sh
  sudo cryptsetup luksFormat --type luks2 /dev/sdSOMETHING
#+end_src

3. Unlock the device with:

#+begin_src sh
  sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdSOMETHING NAME
#+end_src

4. Write a filesystem in it

#+begin_src sh
  # Choose any filesytem you'd like. ext4 is often enough.
  sudo mkfs -t ext4 -V /dev/mapper/DEVICE
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
[!NOTE]

Consider making a smaller, non-encrypted partition to leave a note such as "return to" information.
#+end_quote

4. Mount the device

#+begin_src sh
  # /mnt/DEVICE seems to be the preferred mount location.
  sudo mount /dev/mapper/DEVICE /where/you/want/it/to/be
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
[!NOTE]

Don't forget to =umount= before removing the device!
#+end_quote

*** Usage

- Mounting ::

  #+begin_src sh
    sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdSOMETHING DEVICE
    sudo mount /dev/mapper/DEVICE /where/you/want/it/to/be
  #+end_src

- Unmounting ::

  #+begin_src sh
    sudo umount /where/you/want/it/to/be
    sudo cryptsetup luksClose DEVICE
  #+end_src
